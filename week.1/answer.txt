Question one
How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?


ANSWER: 
Let's suppose that the folder is on desktop directory under the name of task1. To hide this folder we follow the following steps:
1. We write on terminal input inviroment using zsh, the command (chflags hidden)
 
2. We drag the folder to terminal. 

3. The application of this looks like this:
hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air desktop % chflags hidden /Users/hackyourfuture/Desktop/task1


As we notice, (hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air ) is the prompt. Desktop is the directory where we are putting task1. And the rest is the command. And /Users/hackyourfuture/Desktop/task1 is the file that we have dragged.
4. Now the file is hidden. But we can access the file by using 
Go form navbar, then we choose go to folder. On the screen we write the name of the folder.
The application of this will look like:
~/desktop/task1
Now we can access our folder.
 
To make our hidden file reappear again,
1. We have to be in desktop directory on terminal
2. We put this command (defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true ; killall Finder) then the folder will appear on desktop.

Question 3

How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message 

We use the command echo with tow time the mark of bigger than >> 
Let's suppose that we have a file named test.txt. the file already have the first message.
To write the second message below, we write the command:
The application of this:
We create a file text.txt in directory testing. We apply command echo using first > then using >> 

hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air testing % touch text.txt
hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air testing % echo first message > text.txt
hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air testing % cat text.txt
first message
hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air testing % echo second message >> text.txt 
hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air testing % cat text.txt
first message
second message
hackyourfuture@Hacks-Air testing %
